*(Note: The complete list of projects covers Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, NLP, and Automation pipelines.)*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, n8n (for automation)

## 💡 Key Learnings

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
* **Model Building:** Implementing algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CNNs.
* **Evaluation:** Understanding metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and RMSE.
* **Automation:** Building low-code workflows to integrate AI models with external services.

## ⚠️ How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Vishwajeeet/21-Days-AIML-Projects-GFG.git](https://github.com/Vishwajeeet/21-Days-AIML-Projects-GFG.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the specific day's folder (e.g., `Day-01-Titanic-Survival`).
3.  Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4.  **Important:** Please ensure you update the dataset file paths in the code (`pd.read_csv('path/to/file')`) to match your local directory structure before running.
